# Overview
[CompTIA Project+](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/project) is ideal for IT professionals who need to manage smaller, less complex projects as part of their other job duties but still have foundational project management skills.
The CompTIA Project+ examination is designed for IT professionals who coordinate or manage small-to-medium-sized projects.

This repository provides notes that I've constructed while studying for the Project+ exam. These notes are designed to be supplementary study material. This repository is in no way affiliated with CompTIA or Pearson VUE and makes no guarantees of accuracy or completeness.
